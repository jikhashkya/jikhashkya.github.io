I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida, working in computational genomics and algorithm development under the supervision of [Dr. Shaojie Zhang](https://www.cecs.ucf.edu/faculty/shaojie-zhang/). My research focuses on developing efficient positional Burrows-Wheeler transform (PBWT)-based algorithms for haplotype matching on biobank-scale data.
